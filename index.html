        I'm sure I'll be back to designing new products one day. For now, I need a break from making guitar straps.

        It's been a long journey since I started working on Original Fuzz with my college roommate and bandmate, Zach Lever. We sold our first item in the fall of 2013, and since that time we've had more helpful employees, friends, family members, supportive artists, and customers than I can name. I'm grateful for every helping hand, seen and unseen, more than I can express. That support has allowed me to chase my dream of entrepreneurship. It's a privilege—and it's been exhausting.

        My first career love is the Ruby programming language, and that's what I need to focus on now. I'm guessing many of you have strong feelings about how the world is changing, but I find the creative possibilities with AI and software to be too exciting to ignore. I need to ride this wave and put Original Fuzz on hold while I do that.
